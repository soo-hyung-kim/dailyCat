# Daily Cat

## Description

Daily Cat tracks the user's habits on water, meals, mood, and spending. Once the user has input these data, the state of the cat and its room changes to match the healthiness of the user's habits. The user can then look back on previous weeks and also reflect in the journal provided.

**Please note that this app started as a project for Wellesley College Hackathon (WHACK) 2023. All drawings used in this app are credited to Alexis Jiang.**

- **Mobile**: A habit tracker can feel like a task sometimes, and by bringing a game aspect to the tracker, the users will feel more incentivized to start and keep healthy habits.
- **Story**: My groupmate and I came up with this idea because all the previous habit trackers we used weren't to our liking. Once we thought of this idea, we were very set on it because it's an app that both of us would actually use. During our presentation of our work, a lot of people also commented that they would use our app!
- **Market**: Anyone who uses a habit tracker would use this app. I also noticed that a lot of habit tracker apps do not have a game aspect so this might appeal to a group of users.
- **Habit**: Since the app tracks habits, it incentivizes the users to come into the app every day to put in their data.
- **Scope**: Since I've worked on this app for the hackathon, I do have some of the programming done. There are still some features that I need to fix and implement, so I believe there are a lot of goals I can work towards. I'm not entirely sure how much work I can get done though.

I did not get a chance to work on this project since I had (and still have) a lot of work to do before my Thanksgiving break. I will be able to work more on this on Wednesday so I am hoping to update this then.

**Week 9**

Note: I am currently working on building an edit screen for users to edit their data. Since it does not work as of right now, I've attached a screenshot of what it looks like. Once I get it working, I will update again.

**Update**:

I was having trouble with trying to link the Edit button on specific journal entries and finally got it to work. It now brings up an edit screen. Next thing I will be working on is allowing users to edit/add the data and have the corresponding entries update accordingly.

**Week 8**
