#  Brainstorming

## Ideas

1. **Gamified to-do list**
- **Description**: A to-do list app with incentives to complete your tasks
- **Category**: Productivity
- **Mobile**: Instead of having to go to a website/link every time, it is easier to have an app that the user can open. Also, sometimes websites do not save information over different sessions so an app will be able to fix this issue.
- **Story**: A to-do list app has been done several times, and while it is a simple app, sometimes it feels like a chore to have to complete the tasks. By including a game aspect, the user can feel incentivized to complete their tasks.
- **Market**: Anyone who uses a to-do list can use this app.
- **Habit**: This app should incentivize building a habit of making and completing to-do lists. The game aspect can reward completion of tasks as well as logging in daily.
- **Scope**: This app should not be very difficult. It does depend on what sort of game I would implement, but I think it will be doable.

1. **Budget tracker**
- **Description**: Keeps track of your spendings and weekly budget
- **Category**: Lifestyle
- **Mobile**: Instead of having to go to a website/link every time, it is easier to have an app that the user can open. Also, sometimes websites do not save information over different sessions so an app will be able to fix this issue.
- **Story**: While a budget tracker is fairly common, if I do end up going with this idea, I will think more on how I can make this app more unique such that more users will be drawn towards using it.
- **Market**: The market is big, but there are also already several budget tracker apps. I will think more on how I can make this app more unique if I choose this idea to go forward with.
- **Habit**: To keep track of how much the user has spent, they should try to enter their spendings consistently. This should lead to them using the app as a habit.
- **Scope**: This app should not be very difficult. I think it will be doable.

1. **Idle game**
- **Description**: A game where you can tap and gain progress throughout different levels (Similar to cookie clickers)

1. **Friends' Timezones**
- **Description**: An app where you can add your friends and see their timezones (maybe add an option to set free time)

1. **Guessing Game**
- **Description**: With different estimating questions (e.g. "How many cemetries are in NYC?"), users can test their guessing skills.

1. **Meal Plans**
- **Description**: Gives different meals that can be made with the given data of which ingredients are available.

## Final Decision

**Note**: I took part in a hackathon over the weekend and started creating a bullet journal app with a game aspect. I would like to keep working on this app. (While I had a groupmate help with the design of the app, the entirety of the programming has been my work.)

**Bullet Journal App**
- **Description**: An app that tracks meals, water, mood, and budget on a daily basis
- **Category**: Lifestyle
- **Mobile**: A habit tracker can feel like a task sometimes, and by bringing a game aspect to the tracker, the users will feel more incentivized to start and keep healthy habits.
- **Story**: My groupmate and I came up with this idea because all the previous habit trackers we used weren't to our liking. Once we thought of this idea, we were very set on it because it's an app that both of us would actually use. During our presentation of our work, a lot of people also commented that they would use our app!
- **Market**: Anyone who uses a habit tracker would use this app. I also noticed that a lot of habit tracker apps do not have a game aspect so this might appeal to a group of users.
- **Habit**: Since the app tracks habits, it incentivizes the users to come into the app every day to put in their data.
- **Scope**: Since I've worked on this app for the hackathon, I do have some of the programming done. There are still some features that I need to fix and implement, so I believe there are a lot of goals I can work towards. I'm not entirely sure how much work I can get done though.
